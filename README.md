To connect a GitHub repository to cPanel, you'll need to clone the repository using the Git Version Control tool in cPanel. This involves adding an SSH key to your cPanel account and then using the cPanel Git interface to clone the repository from GitHub.
Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Generate an SSH Key:
   On your local machine: Use the command ssh-keygen -t rsa to generate an SSH key.
   Copy the public key: Use the command cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to display your public key.
2. Add the Public Key to cPanel:
   Log in to your cPanel account.
   Navigate to "SSH Access" and then "Manage SSH Keys."
   Copy and paste the public key into the "Public Key" field and click "Import".
3. Create a Git Repository in cPanel:
   Log in to your cPanel account.
   Navigate to "Git Version Control" (usually under "Files").
   Click "Create" to create a new repository.
   In the "Clone a Repository" section, toggle the switch to enable cloning.
   Paste the SSH URL of your GitHub repository into the "Clone URL" field.
   Specify the "Repository Path" (where the repository will be stored on the cPanel server) and a "Repository Name".
   Click "Create".
4. (Optional) Set up Deployment Keys for GitHub:
   Go to your GitHub repository's settings.
   Navigate to "Deploy keys"
   Paste the public key from cPanel into the "Key" field and add a title for the key.
   Click "Add key".
5. (Optional) Configure cPanel for Automated Deployment (using GitHub Actions):
   In your GitHub repository, create a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file with instructions for deploying your code to cPanel.
   Set up a new FTP account in cPanel (if you haven't already) and note the username, server, and port.
   Add the FTP credentials as repository secrets in your GitHub repository settings.
   Important Notes:
   Make sure you have the correct permissions to create and manage repositories on your cPanel account.
   If you're using a private repository, you may need to set up deployment keys in GitHub to allow automated deployment from cPanel.
   For automated deployment, you can use GitHub Actions to trigger deployments when you push changes to your GitHub repository.
